            <h2>Terms Of Service</h2>

            <p>Hello Users</p>
			
             <h2>Terms of Use</h2>
These Terms and Conditions constitute an agreement (“Agreement”) between you (“you”, “your”, “user”, “Customer”) and the Mars Company.A terms of use is an agreement that a user must agree to and abide by in order to use a website or service. Terms of use (TOU) can go by many other names, including terms of service (TOS) and terms and conditions. ... Websites should always have a terms of use regarding user activity, accounts, products, and technology.

<h2>Eligibility and Identity.</h2>
To be eligible to use our Services, you must be at least 13 years old. . Along with the type of data to be collected, determining who will be eligible to register in the ID system is a first-order decision with implications for the inclusivity, cost, utility, and overall development of the system.Restricting a foundational ID system to only nationals can also be exclusionary for many people who are nationals but are unable to prove this. This is particularly the case in jus sanguinis countries, where—in contrast to jus soli countries that recognize citizenship for anyone born within their jurisdiction—nationality determination requires more than documentation of a person’s birth location (e.g., it may also require documentation of parental nationality).

<h2>Termination</h2>
You may terminate this Agreement at any time by ceasing all use of the Services and by notifying us. The Company may terminate this Agreement, at any time, without notice to you, if it believes, in its sole judgment, that you have breached or may breach any term or condition of this Agreement. A "Termination" clause is a clause found in a legal agreement that allows for the agreement to be terminated, or ended, under circumstances specified in the clause. The termination clause is typically placed within a Terms and Conditions agreement of a website or app

You acknowledge that the operation of the Service may from time to time encounter technical or other problems and may not necessarily continue uninterrupted or without technical or other errors and The Company shall not be responsible to you or others for any such interruptions, errors or problems or an outright discontinuance of the Service.
