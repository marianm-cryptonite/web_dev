		Along with the type of data to be collected, determining who will be eligible to register in the ID system is a first-order decision with implications for the inclusivity, cost, utility, and overall development of the system.
		Restricting a foundational ID system to only nationals can also be exclusionary for many people who are nationals but are unable to prove this. 
		This is particularly the case in jus sanguinis countries, where—in contrast to jus soli countries that recognize citizenship for anyone born within their jurisdiction—nationality determination requires more than documentation of a person’s birth location (e.g., it may also require documentation of parental nationality).</p>
